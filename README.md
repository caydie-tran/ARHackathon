# ARHackathon

## Ideas:

1. Shape-shifting animals/Teen Titans/Harry Potter boggart
2. Find Slenderman (randomly spawns), menus
3. Landscaping

## Overview
1. Select a scary object (default Slenderman)
2. Walk around your space
3. Your selected object will pop up on your screen at a random time
4. You have 1 second to look away from it before you DIE
5. Survive the 30 seconds to win the game

## Flow
1. Starting the game (start screen showing character model w/instructions) 

    Start button

2. Game begins (random spawning)

    Spawn scary object on origin randomly 3 times within 10 sec - 30 sec

    Player has 1 second to look away each time

    "You Lose" screen pops up if you don't look away fast enough (Display You Died at {} Sec)

3. Game ends at 30 sec

    You win screen

    Start Screen


## Requirements
1. Slenderman 3D model
2. Static screens

    Start page with instructions: "When this pops up, look away as fast as you can!"

    Lose page

    Win page
3. Game logic
